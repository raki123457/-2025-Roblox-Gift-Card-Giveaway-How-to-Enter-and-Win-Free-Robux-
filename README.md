No legitimate giveaway will ever ask you for your Roblox password or login credentials. If a giveaway asks you to provide this, it‚Äôs likely a phishing scam designed to steal your account information. **Never share your password with anyone**.

There are numerous websites and apps that claim to give you free Robux in exchange for completing surveys or downloading apps. **Avoid these at all costs**‚Äîthey are often scams that can infect your device with malware or steal your personal information.

#### **3. Watch for Fake Social Media Accounts**
Some scammers impersonate well-known Roblox influencers and creators to run fake giveaways. Always double-check that the giveaway is hosted by the official account of the person or brand. Look for verification badges or other signs that the account is legitimate.

#### **4. Don‚Äôt Pay to Enter**
Legitimate giveaways should always be free to enter. **Never pay money** to participate in a Roblox gift card giveaway. If a giveaway requires payment or asks you to purchase something to win, it‚Äôs a scam.
